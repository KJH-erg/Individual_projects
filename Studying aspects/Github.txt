Some bacis git CLI codes
$ git init
line to create local repository
$ git config --global user.email "Email"
line to register user email
$ git config -- global user.name "User name"
line to register username
$git add file
send a file to stage (number of files to be added in commit)
$ git commit -m "message"
create a commit with the message
$ git log
code to check the information of commits such as username, email, message, Data, and commit ID
$ git checkout git-ID
move to commit with the identical ID
$ git checkout -
to checkout to the newest commit
$ git remote add origin Github repository URL
To set the remote repository connected to local directory
$ git push origin master
to push checked-out commit in the master branch to the remote repository
$ git clone  Github repository URL . ("  ." is important )
To clone the remote repository to local directory
$ git pull origin master
to get the new commit in the remote repository and copy the changed files in the local repository

origin is the typical name for the repository so means add reposity named origin from the URL
$ git remote add origin Github repository URL
master is the main branch of the git

Branch is the method to make different versions from the same version(commit)
Without making different branches, news commits can only be made with the newest commits
Head is a pointer to check out(select) different commits or branches

when creating new branches make sure checking out the branch that one wants to make a branch from

Merging
3 types
Merge commit - after merging branches a new commit is created
Fast Forward - after merging branches the same commit is created
Conflict - in case the same files are changed simultaneously in the same place

Pull request is a polite method to ask other teammates that one's branches can be merged to the master branch
reviews comments and votes are used to communicate with other teammates

Fetch is the code to update the branches from repository unlike the pull downloading actual codes.
Thus after fetching, pull is required to match the local diretory(master) with repository

Tag is the message pointing the certain commit before releasing

Fork is the process to copy other's repository in my repository 
similar to branching, but cannot access to the original repository (To be a contributer)
This forked repository can be merged to the orignal repository by pull requesting to the original repository
remote is used to check the changes of the orignal repository upstream is a typical name for the original repository

Rebase is similar to merge (merging two branches into one)
However, rebasing is not creating a new merged commit but just branching changed features from the master branch

amend is to fix a latest commit even if the commit is already pushed
we do not need to make another commit
However, if we want to push the amended commit forced push is required

Cherry picking
when the user wants a change in a certain commit of a branch, cherry picking is utilized 

Reset
reset the commit to a certain commit of the branch
soft/mixed reset keep changed parts of the the past commit
hard reset removes all history of commits the after the selected commit

revert
if you want to keep the history of the commits after the reverted commit, revert is used 

Stash
if you want to keep the changed part but not complete, use stash to save the changed parts and call from stash part for the future

The git theory
after adding unstaged files from working tree  to stage
index file is showing the stage status
objects directory is showing the copied object added from working tree
