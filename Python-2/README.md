Create a program to read a text file with various tweets. The output should be 2 text files-one that contains the list of all unique words among all tweets along with the count for repeated words and the second file should contain the median of unique words for all tweets.

result_count.csv is the file to show the frequency of the words.
result_median is the file to show the median of each tweet.
